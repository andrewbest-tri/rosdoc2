    ## If this is true, a standard index page is generated in the output directory.
    ## It uses the package information from the 'package.xml' to show details
    ## about the package, creates a table of contents for the various builders
    ## that were run, and may contain links to things like build farm jobs for
    ## this package or links to other versions of this package.

    ## If false, you can still include content that would have been in the index
    ## into one of your '.rst' files from your Sphinx project, using the
    ## '.. include::' directive in Sphinx.
    ## For example, you could include it in a custom 'index.rst' so you can have
    ## the standard information followed by custom content.

    ## TODO(wjwwood): provide a concrete example of this (relative path?)

    ## If this is not specified explicitly, it defaults to 'true'.

builders:
    ## Each stanza represents a separate build step, performed by a specific 'builder'.
    ## The key of each stanza is the builder to use; this must be one of the
    ## available builders.
    ## The value of each stanza is a dictionary of settings for the builder that
    ## outputs to that directory.
    ## Required keys in the settings dictionary are:
    ##  * 'output_dir' - determines output subdirectory for builder instance
    ##                   relative to --output-directory
    ##  * 'name' - used when referencing the built docs from the index.
